  dynamian_description: Stanley came to Australia in 2003 for his new life adventure. Within these years, he has been living in lots of different areas, like Moonee Pond, Clayton, Brighton, Boxhill, Coburg and Essendon. He meets lots of friends from different countries, Janpanese, Chinese, Egyptian, Italian, Americian etc. However, he found that there are lots of shops surrounding him, open and close. Some of them are good friends of him. It is happy to see friends open 1, 2 or more stops. But it is sad to see them closed. Hence, Stanley comes up with an idea, Dynamic Valley, it is a website to introduce his friends' business.
