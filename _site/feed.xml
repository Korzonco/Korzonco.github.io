        <title>Dynamic Valley is Founded!!</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;This is the first post of &lt;b&gt; Dynamic Valley &lt;/b&gt;. 
The vision of Dynamic Valley is to connect local stores to local residents.
In Dynamic Valley website, there is no payment system such as PayPal, credit card or anything else like that. 
&lt;b&gt; BECAUSE!! &lt;/b&gt;
The purposes of Dynamic Valley is to encourage local residents go to their local stores to touch, smell and feel the products and services which online stores canâ€™t provide. Lots of people has also sufferred enough on so many low quality online products and services. We, &lt;b&gt; Dynamians &lt;/b&gt; would like to build a bridge for local residents to find good quality local stores.&lt;/p&gt;
